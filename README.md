# autophagyTransportModel
mean-field models for autophagosome transport, endolysosomal fusion, and maturation.

Run the script getOrganelleDensities.m to calculate the distribution of AVs and Lysosomes involved in neuronal autophagy. This script will plot the distribution of LC3+ and LAMP1+ puncta, as well as the distribution of unfused AVs and lysosomes for a given set of parameters. Parameters can be set and edited within the script.

This program was created using MATLAB version 9.10.0.1602886 (R2021a).
